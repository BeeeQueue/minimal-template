# Minimal Node/Web Project

This is my minimal template that I use for all my new projects.

It has:

- [tsup](https://tsup.egoist.sh/) for easily bundling code
- [vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for testing
- All the editor configurations you might need
- Automatic code formatting on committing with prettier and simple-git-hooks
